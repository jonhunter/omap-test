Timer Test Description		Command
----------------------		-------
Test timer request APIs.	"echo 1 > /sys/kernel/debug/omap-test/timer/request"
Tests a timer (verifies	counter	"echo <timer-number> > /sys/kernel/debug/omap-test/timer/one"
increments, as well as overflow
and match interrupts).
Tests all timers (verifies	"echo 1 > /sys/kernel/debug/omap-test/timer/all"
counters increment, as well as
overflow and match interrupts).
Repeatedly tests all timers	"echo 1 > /sys/kernel/debug/omap-test/timer/stress"
(verifies counters increment,
as well as overflow and match
